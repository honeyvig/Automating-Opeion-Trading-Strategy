# Automating-Option-Trading-Strategy
Define the specific candle numbers (e.g., the first candle, the third candle, etc.) to determine when to execute the options trade.
Options Execution Strategy with Stop-Loss:

Call Option Execution:

Condition: If the high of the selected candle (e.g., Candle 1) is broken by the next candle:
Action: Buy a call option.
Stop-Loss: Set the stop-loss at the low of the executed candle (Candle 1).

Put Option Execution:

Condition: If the low of the selected candle (e.g., Candle 1) is broken by the next candle:
Action: Buy a put option.
Stop-Loss: Set the stop-loss at the high of the executed candle (Candle 1).
Confirmation: Ensure the next candle closes below the selected candle's low for confirmation.
Time Frame: Use a 1-minute time frame for precise entries.

========================
Python implementation of the defined options execution strategy. The code assumes historical or live data is retrieved via an API or loaded from a file.

# Sample data structure for candles

# Load data into DataFrame

Explanation

    Candle Selection:
        The strategy starts by selecting the initial candle (Candle 1) to compare future candles against.
    Call Option Execution:
        If a candle’s high breaks Candle 1’s high, a call option is triggered.
        Stop-loss is set to the low of Candle 1.
    Put Option Execution:
        If a candle’s low breaks Candle 1’s low, a put option is triggered.
        Stop-loss is set to the high of Candle 1.
    Confirmation:
        A call trade requires the next candle to close above Candle 1’s high.
        A put trade requires the next candle to close below Candle 1’s low.

Output Example

For the given sample data, the script will:

    Identify triggers based on the selected candle.
    Log each trade with entry price, stop-loss, and confirmation status.

Integration

    Replace the data dictionary with a live data feed from a broker API (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca).
    Extend the script to execute trades programmatically using APIs from your broker.
